 EQUESTRIA_FRACTURED_NAME:0 "Equestria Fractured"
 TMP_EQUESTRIA_FRACTURED_DESC:0 "Built by a group of Equestrian exiles and outcasts seeking refuge from the chaos engulfing their homeland, the Tempest Realm is a stratocratic state led by Fizzlepop Berrytwist for a single purpose; to prevent the revival of the Storm King by the storm creatures to the far south. To accomplish this she has slipped back into her old war persona, gathering loyal storm creatures to form an army which makes up the basis of her state. While their goal for now is clear, however, what is less so is what the 'nation' will become once victory is achieved... and why the Equestrians are there in the first place."
