 STM_storm_prince:0 "The Storm Prince"
 STM_storm_prince_desc:0 "The Storm Prince, as he is now known among the Storm Creatures, has humble beginnings too unimportant to be put to the page. He was part of the army which invaded and pillaged countless kingdoms, from Abyssinia to Hippogriffia, and was even a part of the vanguard force which took Canterlot itself. And yet, that great triumph also became his greatest failure, for he was one of the two who allowed the vile Abyssinian known as Capper through the gates of Canterlot, allowing the traitor Celeano, her pirates and the Element Bearers to sneak into the city undetected. This mistake resulted in the death of their leader and a total rout of the Storm Creatures, with the vast majority returning home with the shame of defeat. He, however, did not.\n\nDisguising his true intentions as wishing to aid in the reconstruction of Canterlot, he remained to gather the shattered pieces of his liege. If the petrification process could be undone for the ponies, it could surely be done for him as well, provided that all his remains were put back together. And with the chaos of the School of Friendship and the end of the last Celestial Era, no attention was given to his search for the magical power needed to bring one back from the dead.\n\nOnce he had found what he was searching for, the storm creature returned to his homeland still wracked with internal strife. There he proclaimed his plans to revive their king, knowing that with the recent Equestrian collapse there would be only one pony willing to travel all the way to the Storm Island to stop him. The same one who frustrated his efforts to revive the Storm King by holding the last shard of him left, the arch-traitor who had sided with the ponies during the critical moment. The last piece of the puzzle.\n\nWhen Tempest Shadow arrived, those resentful of her quickly flocked to his banner and crowned him as their Storm Prince, as he expected. Now, with most of the island under his banner, he can now set his sights on the last bastion of resistance to the revival of the one creature who can return the Storm Creatures to greatness. When Tempest Shadow and the ones foolish enough to join her fall, then a plan countless moons in the making will finally come to fruition.\n\nThe Prince will see his King return, no matter the cost."
