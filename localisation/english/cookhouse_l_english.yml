 cookhouse.1.t:0 "Aftermath"
 cookhouse.1.d:0 ""Princess Twilight!" The voice rang out in the dead of night, waking two ponies from their half-slumber. Both the alicorn and Sunset Shimmer looked up bleary-eyed from the papers on the table to find Prince Blueblood already in front of them, waiting impatiently in what looked like his night clothes. He eyed the latter with no small amount of disdain before continuing. "I have just discovered that Princess Celestia has disappeared from Canterlot, and no one saw fit to inform me."\n\n"I..." Twilight sputtered for a moment. "None of us were sure of what happened at first. Sunset and I decided-"\n\n"Of course," Blueblood interrupted, snarling. "The two students, working together as always." He turned his attention to the field marshal glaring back at him. "I must congratulate you, Shimmer, for finally getting what you've always wanted. At long last, my aunt has finally been pushed off her throne. Tell me, do you feel satisfied?" Twilight opened her mouth to reply.\n\n"Don't bother," Sunset said, staring daggers right back at the prince. "He could never accept that Celestia was more devoted to us instead of him. Isn't that right?"\n\nBlueblood's normally controlled demeanor broke completely into a mask of pure fury. "You do not get to judge me," he seethed. "I was here long before either of you dreamed of being in this castle. You have no idea what it was like, living the life of a lie hoping that she would notice you again one day. I had hoped she had learned from one student betraying her, but no. How did it feel, Shimmer, knowing you were replaceable too?"\n\n"Blueblood, that is enough." Twilight firmly extended a hoof to hold Sunset back. "Celestia leaving has affected all of us."\n\nThe prince laughed. "And what would you know about her?" he challenged, taking another step towards the princess standing by the stained-glass windows. "She had to be the perfect teacher for you. You have no idea who she really was when it was just the two of us!" He bared his teeth. "Before you and Shimmer and-"\n\nBlueblood finally noticed the streak of moonlight illuminating the papers on the table and turned his snarl to the window. The Mare in the Moon stared back, hauntingly beautiful and uncomfortably familiar. Twilight and Sunset watched as all the color slowly drained out of Blueblood's face, leaving his normally pristine white closer to a deathly pale. "I..." he stopped, emotionless. "I believe I need time alone. My apologies."\n\nThe two mares looked at each other with confusion etched on their muzzles as Blueblood quickly hurried away, vanishing into the darkened halls of the palace."

 cookhouse.2.t:0 "Sunflowers"
 cookhouse.2.d:0 "There was once a farm on the edge of Equestria. The old owners had been wanting to move to the east coast for a long time, so it had been up for sale for a few months prior. Now, it was run by a new unicorn named Sunny Days. She was a newcomer, having appeared out of nowhere and mostly staying to the dilapidated farmhouse. Curiously, the only things she grew in her fields were sunflowers, which she would sometimes offer to the rare pony trotting the dirt road which trailed along the farmland.\n\nUsually the ponies she saw were the rough rural types. That was what she found one day as a dirty white unicorn came trotting along, a heavy dirt blonde beard obscuring his lower muzzle. Judging by the faded uniform, he seemed to be a veteran from the army. "Would you like a sunflower?" she asked politely as he approached, weariness obvious in his trot and expression. His eyes, however, studied her closely as if they were looking for something.\n\n"You know," he finally began, turning his attention to the flowers in the field, "I hated your students at first. I missed the time we spent together, years ago. Back when things felt simple."\n\nSunny Days bowed her head and returned to her sunflowers. She had hoped leaving would have made it easier on him than trying to explain, but if this was what he needed to move on, then she would take whatever he needed to throw at her. Then she would go back to being alone again.\n\n"...the other ponies here told me your name was Sunny Days. I see you've gotten at least a little better at acting. Funny, there's a million things I wanted to say, and yet... Perhaps the best way to start is to apologize." Sunny blinked but did not look at him, instead continuing to tend to her sunflowers.\n\n"I told myself that they would never understand the pain I felt at losing you. At watching you slip away. But only now do I realize that it was I who could never understand your pain. The countless nights you must have spent looking up at the moon. The nights you spend now, even after casting aside the crown."\n\nBlueblood turned to leave. "Twilight was right," he finally admitted. "I can see that clearly now. And I still have my duties to Equestria to fulfill. But someday, when I hang up my uniform for the last time, I will come back here. You don't have to be alone for this. Forgive me for being so selfish."\n\nAfter sparing one last look behind him, Blueblood began trotting away. Sunny Days merely watched from the edge of her field while he disappeared out of sight. Only then did a few tears fall from her eyes, as she whispered, "Oh, Blueblood. I already have.""

 cookhouse.3.t:0 "Best Laid Plans"
 cookhouse.3.d:0 "Rainbow Dash wasn't exactly sure how long she had been held at the makeshift Solarist prison. A few weeks, if she had to guess. At one point she had considered marking down the days in her cell, but that would have implied that she expected to stay there for a long time. And Rainbow 'Danger' Dash never stayed in one place for long. In fact, she was breaking out of here tonight.\n\n...As long as the Lunarists would stop being such a pain in her flank about it.\n\n"Remind me again why we have to do all the dangerous parts of this plan?" Sharp Shadow questioned, eyebrow raised as the other thestrals near him eyed Rainbow with suspicion. "We may be willing to give our lives bringing down the Sun Tyrant, but only for the Nightmare. Not for your outdated notions of harmony or friendship."\n\nAnd there it was again. That question was like the broken clock that nopony cared about in the Wonderbolt Academy break room. Rainbow sighed as she repeated the same response she had for the past week. "You guys are way better at seeing in the dark and avoiding capture than any of us even without your wings," she replied, keeping her voice level. "Once we find the keys to the chains keeping our wings bound, we'll wait for you to loop back around before all flying out together."\n\n"So that you can take us right back to your own prison, right?"\n\n"All of us will still be unarmed," the pegasus patiently reminded Sharp. "If you want to try and capture me for Nightmare Moon, go ahead. But I think we can both agree that it would be a better idea to try it after we're away from the Solarists." Rainbow Dash sighed, feeling the enchanted metal chafe against her one wing. If she still had her prosthetic, this whole prison escape would be so much easier. "Look, I promise we're not going to betray you. And as the Element of Loyalty, I take those pretty seriously."\n\nThe thestrals didn't seem very moved. "We'll see," Sharp Shadow finally said, turning to leave. "Should the Nightmare will it... we will help in this escape from the soldiers of the Sun Tyrant."\n\nIt wasn't a better response than the past week of negotiations. Still, it would have to do. The prison break was planned for tonight, and Rainbow Dash would rather eat dirt than let the countless innocents and dissidents here down."

 cookhouse.4.t:0 "Where It All Goes Wrong"
 cookhouse.4.d:0 ""Where are they?" Rainbow tapped her hoof impatiently against the floor as she and the other Equestrians waited in the office for the thestrals to arrive. The various manacles and enchanted chains keeping their wings bounds were all piled in a corner, and she could tell that a few ponies were already getting antsy about getting out of here. But she had made a promise to the Lunarists, and nopony here was going to leave without her. She was the whole reason they had gotten this far, anyway.\n\nMinutes passed as the clock ticked onwards. This was taking too long. Rainbow was starting to debate whether she should just leave the keys on the table when the door finally opened. "Finally!" she exclaimed as the thestrals trotted in. "I could have made it to Cloudsdale and back with how long you-"\n\nThe pegasus froze. All of them were armed. And Sharp Shadow was aiming a revolver right at her head. "Keys," he said coldly, motioning for the ring of them on the desk nearby. "Did you really think we'd just let you go after this? The Nightmare has made it clear that you and the Element Bearers are her highest priority. Now, you will follow us and behave or-"\n\nA shot rang out, and a thestral slumped to the ground, blood leaking from his head.\n\nThe room erupted into utter chaos as the Solarist guards started swarming into the room, shooting both Lunarist and harmonist alike. Rainbow Dash took cover behind a table with a few other earth ponies, cursing until she noticed a gleam of metal nearby. One of the lockers had fallen over, revealing her confiscated prosthetic wing gleaming from the moonlight through a nearby window. One of the earth ponies saw it too; he lunged forward to slide it back towards the table, right before getting shot twice through the head.\n\n"Quick, get it on!" Rainbow hissed to the two ponies left as they fit it into the metal socket still on her left back. As soon as she felt the magical reconnection, she raised it skyward and watched the sharp metal slice right through a charging thestral above them who slammed into the wall.\n\nRainbow looked at the window nearby. It looked like it could barely fit her, much less anypony else she could carry. The earth ponies seemed to notice that too. "Just get out of here!" one of them said. "Go to Fillydelphia and get help! We'll be fine!" She hesitated for a moment, then nodded and quickly launched herself skyward, bursting through the glass and out into the night sky."
 cookhouse.4.a:0 "The echoes of gunfire quickly ceased behind her."
 
 cookhouse.5.t:0 "Too Little, Too Late"
 cookhouse.5.d:0 "Night was fading away. The moon was slowly falling across the horizon, signaling that day was almost ready to break once again. From a nearby hill, Rainbow Dash looked down into the campgrounds, easily able to see the groups of ponies being herded into lines by worn Solarist soldiers. She noted that there were much fewer thestrals than before, and many more bodies being piled away in a pit they had dug nearby. It seemed that the harmonists were much more willing to surrender than the Lunarist counterparts.\n\nThere had to be a way to free them. Rainbow had found a gun during her escape, and it still had quite a bit of ammunition left in it. Not enough to clear the camp, but if she aimed her shots well it could probably open enough gaps for the prisoners to find their own. Fillydelphia was too far; there was no way she could make it there and back in time to free them, even with her speed.\n\nSomething was happening. A few uniformed Solarists marched back to a sharply-dressed uniform, likely the officer in charge. There was a few seconds of discussion, then one of them pointed outside the camp, in the direction of Rainbow Dash. She ducked just in case they had somehow seen her, but the mare doubted it by how the officer was throwing their hat on the ground in clear frustration. He then pointed at the prisoners left in line.\n\nThere was the sound of countless gunshots. Then every single pony in line fell to the ground, blood pooling around them. It only took a few seconds for the soldiers to start gathering their bodies to take them to the dump pit.\n\nRainbow's blood went cold. That was it. Just like that, every single pony that had helped her escape was gone. She could still remember the fear in their eyes back in the office, when they were waiting to all leave together. Could they have made it out if she had just given permission. Would they still be alive if she just wasn't there at all? Some of them had seemed so confident in her, telling her that they were honored to be with an Element of Harmony. Was this their punishment for that?\n\nThe pegasus turned away. There was nothing left for her here. She readied her wings before launching herself skyward, leaving a sonic rainboom in her wake. At this point, she didn't care about being seen. Nothing would be able to catch up anyway.\n\nThe guilt, though, that was already with her."

All of this and more can be installed at a moment's notice, if you would just sign here and put initials here!"\n\nApplejack took the clipboard from Flim's magic and barely glanced at the paper before writing her name in pen on the dotted line. The two brothers stared slack-jawed at each other before clearing their throats. "Well, that was certainly fast. I have to say Applejack, when you called us over to Sweet Apple Acres we thought you were trying to pull something over on us, considering that, well..."\n\n"Well, that we haven't always been entirely honest with you or the rest of Ponyville," Flam finished, staring suspiciously at the farmmare.\n\nApplejack sighed, setting the signed documents down and shifting uncomfortably from side to side. "I know I ain't the smartest of ponies," she finally admitted, her voice betraying difficulty in finding the right words. "I could get some fancy types like Twilight to look over this and make sure you two ain't up to any schemes. But after working together during the war, with y'all being mostly honest the whole time, I figure I can give you at least this much trust once."\n\n"But what about Sweet Apple Acres?" Flam pressed on, his mustache twitching. "Surely it must be difficult for you to give up your way of doing things?"\n\n"Oh it sure as Celestia is," Applejack confirmed, nodding. "Your fancy machines still stir up all kinds of feelings in my head. I even had nightmares of all my friends and I getting replaced by machine versions of ourselves! But after talking with Luna in my dreams, I realized that I was seeing everything wrong." The earth pony looked past the pair of unicorns into the distance, where rows upon rows of apple trees stood across endless fields. "I was scared of everything about the future. Worried that one day, those things you made would make me obsolete one day. But they're just tools, and it's ponies like me that decide how to use them. Fighting change ain't gonna accomplish anything, so I might as well make sure it happens in a way that benefits everypony... even you two."\n\nThe brothers were stunned into silence. Flim was the first to recover, lightly coughing into a hoof. "Well, my dear Applejack, my brother and I must admit we learned a thing or two from you as well," he said, voice surprisingly honest. "And you have our sincere promise that this time, the two of us will be real partners with your family."\n\n"Our schemes were getting nowhere anyway," Flam added. "We'd rather build something legitimate now, something that'll last!"\n\nApplejack smiled. "You know you two, I think things might work out between us after all.""

 cookhouse.7.t:0 "Breaking Point"
 cookhouse.7.d:0 "How did it end up like this?\n\nHer advisors had called it a victory. Stalliongrad had played its hand, and it had completely backfired on them. Their call for a general strike across all of Equestria had been barely supported by those within Equestria, and any protests against the Crown had been met with even larger pro-Harmony counterprotests. By all their accounts Equestria was safe and secure, at least from the threat of communist infiltration.\n\nThat was what Celestia had thought too, after the revolution. She could still remember in this very room, almost a century ago, the day Caramel Marks had spoken passionately to her about radical change to solve Equestria's problems. As Princess she had seen countless ponies like Caramel before, those with bold ideas left disappointed by the slow movement of progress to avoid unnecessary conflict and strife. Never could Celestia have imagined the consequences resulting from her vision of a better world. It was why she was here once again, with nopony else but a Stalliongradian diplomat bereft of his expected leverage.\n\n"I tried," Celestia said barely loud enough for him to hear as she stared out the window. "I left you alone. I gave you what you wanted. Against the advice of every pony around me I let you go, hoping you would find your own way. That for her sake, we could find peace."\n\nA gentle, tired sigh came from her muzzle. She turned away to look at the stallion, her eyes full of weariness and regret. "But you won't stop. I gave you every opportunity I could, and yet you continue to fight. I have made many mistakes and carry many regrets, one of them in this very room. But you leave me no choice but to act."\n\nCelestia's horn glowed a faint gold and a group of royal guards entered the room, surrounding the Stalliongradian. "Wha- what is the meaning of this?" he asked, his shout deafening compared to the Princess' soft tone. "Celestia, what are you doing?"\n\n"I won't let this be the end of Equestria," the alicorn responded, looking down upon the stallion. "Not like this. You have left us with no other option but to fight back. Guards, please escort him out of the palace and summon my sister and Miss Inkwell."\n\nAs the Severyanian left the room sputtering, Celestia took a deep breath and looked back to the window. "I'm sorry, Caramel," she whispered to the setting sun. "Your students have lost their way. I only wish I could have helped them sooner.""

 cookhouse.8.d:0 "It had started small, at first. A single incident in the city of Mareway, a confrontation between the local communist movement and the police. Had it happened a year ago, it would have been resolved within days without bloodshed. Now it was the spark that ignited Equestria, an opportunity seized by the Equestrian Communist Party to call for a general strike. The unions, all armed and coordinated by Stalliongrad took over countless city halls and administrative offices effectively staging open rebellion against the Crown. Now, a Severyanian diplomat was en route to Canterlot within the week, no doubt to present demands for the abdication of the Princesses and a new government.\n\nCelestia did not have an answer.\n\n"Sister, so rarely have We seen a matter weigh so heavily on your mind," Princess Luna said as Celestia looked away from her. ""Please, what is the matter? Surely you have dealt with such insurrection before?"\n\n"Not like this," she whispered back. "Have I truly made such mistakes to cause so many to hate me so? To be willing to fight and die to see the crown off my head?"\n\n"You have done no such thing. You must not let the work of the Severyanians inspire such doubt in yourself, sister. It is them who have poisoned the minds of our ponies against us."\n\nCelestia turned to face the Night Princess, tears in her eyes. A flash of recognition sparked in Luna's memory; a similar expression on her muzzle as they fought over a thousand years ago, deep in the Everfree. "I cannot do it, Luna," she answered. "I cannot send ponies to kill our own, no matter how misguided they may be. And yet, neither can I abandon those who continue to have faith in the Crown. So long have I made every effort to avoid bloodshed... has it all been for nothing?"\n\nLuna remained silent as her sister wept. So much time had passed during her banishment, she reflected, and there was still so much she could not understand. Celestia had taken the past millennia with a strength Luna could only imagine, and shouldered its countless burdens. And now, as she watched this burden threaten to break the pony she held most dear, Luna's resolve only hardened. "Sister, give up the crown. Let Us rule alone."\n\nCelestia's ears perked up, and she looked at her sibling in surprise. "You... would take this on alone?" she asked.\n\n"We would. We have sacrificed much for Equestria in ages long forgotten, working in your shadow. Let this be our chance to defend our home, just as you have for centuries past."\n\n"Let Us fight... for Equestria.""

 cookhouse.9.d:0 "The tiara on her head had not changed since her sister's abdication. It was the same one she had worn for the past decade, simple in its design. And yet, it could not feel more different now. It held the weight not of a lesser diarch of Equestria, but of its sole Princess. That, alongside the Field Marshal's uniform she wore gave her power she could only have dreamed of as the Nightmare. And all she had to do to attain it was ask.\n\nThe door opened, and Luna snapped out of her self-reflection. The Severyanian diplomat strode into the room with all the confidence of a victor, documents in hoof. Setting them down on the table, he gave a short nod of respect to the alicorn. "Princess Luna," he addressed simply, giving no weight to the title. "The unions are ready to negotiate for a return to order, with I serving as their representative-"\n\n"Negotiate? We were unaware there would be any negotiations." Luna took no small amount of enjoyment from watching the confidence instantly disappear from the Severyanian, replaced with confusion.\n\n"But surely you are aware of the strikes? The impending violence?"\n\nLuna raised an eyebrow, which the Night Guard present took as a sign to slowly close in on the diplomat. "All We have seen are traitors revealing their true allegiances," she responded coldly. "Insurrections to be quelled. We do not negotiate with such ponies."\n\nThe diplomat sputtered, fear seeping into his eyes. "But the bloodshed!" he tried, looking for a way out. "You would really choose war over peace?"\n\nThe Night Princess raised a hoof and the Lunar Guard halted, ready to drag the Severyanian out. She leaned her head down, looking eye to eye with the stallion. "You are all traitors to Equestria and the crown," she stated without a hint of inflection. "You do not care how many ponies are killed for your ideals. We have always known what you truly intended behind your false smiles, promising peace and safety while rallying ponies to your diseased mindset. You skulk in the dark, like all the other enemies of Equestria. Like my shadow. This is not the beginning of your revolution."\n\nPrincess Luna made a small motion with her head and the thestrals nearby nodded, grabbing the diplomat and dragging him away as he struggled to break free. She watched with no emotion as they paused at the door, the communist getting one last look at the now sole Princess of Equestria, pure terror etched on his muzzle.\n\n"This is your end.""

She had left this room with nothing but disappointment, as she tried to explain the slow change that had brought Equestria peace for centuries. Now, as the Stalliongrad diplomat sat down and brought forth the list of demands, she could only wonder how it ended this way.\n\nIt had started small, at first. A single incident in the city of Mareway, a confrontation between the local communist movement and the police. It quickly became the spark that ignited Equestria, an opportunity seized by the Equestrian Communist Party to call for a general strike. But it was the overwhelming support for the revolution, all across Equestria which had left Celestia with no choice. To fight back would be to condemn all of Equestria to unimaginable bloodshed.\n\n"...You and all the other alicorns will surrender all your titles, and allow a provisional elected government to lead until true elections can be instituted," the stallion summarized, pushing the set of documents over to the alicorn. "You and any other former royalty will be allowed to go free, and we promise not to prosecute you for any acts taken as monarchs of Equestria."\n\n"And what about the ponies who still believe in the Crown?" Celestia asked. "I will not sign away my crown for my own safety so you can call any punitive action justice."\n\nThe Severyanian paused for a moment. "Any remaining monarchists will be free of reprisal, as long as they do not openly defy or fight the new government," he responded carefully. "You have the word of the General Secretary."\n\nShe nodded, and glanced once more at the list of demands at her hooves. "...Most monarchs would spit on this," she sighed, "and regret to their dying day not ordering another charge into Princessyn."\n\nHer horn ignited, and the guards at the door instinctively raised their rifles. But Celestia merely lifted the tiara off her head and set it gently down on the table. "But I shall live a long time and already carry enough regrets," she finished. "I am glad that these bullet points on on parchment and not erupting from a rifle. If this is what it takes to have peace..."\n\nThe quill moved gracefully across the papers, Celestia's name signed in impossibly perfect cursive on each line. "...then I shall step aside for the good of Equestria. I merely have one question left."\n\nCelestia looked straight into the diplomat's eyes, her own soft and sad. "What was my mistake?" she asked. "What could I have done differently, to avoid all this needless conflict?"\n\nThe room was silent. Celestia stood up, moving for the door. "Perhaps I will never know," she called back.

Once that had been successful, he had expected to never return here, and to spend the rest of his life back home in Chiropterra. Fate had chosen otherwise, and after two brutal defeats at the hooves of Equestria and Aris he had found himself back as part of a diplomatic mission from Aris and their allies. Carrot was no fool; he knew that the Hippogriffs were his one lifeline here, and resolved to never let himself out of Queen Novo and Princess Skystar's sight.\n\nThey were nowhere to be found. The only one in the room with him was the Princess, who approached him slowly with hate in her eyes. Carrot felt the wall behind him as he backed up as far as he could.\n\n"I remember you," she said, her voice emotionless. "Working here in the castle, with the night staff. I trusted you. My sister trusted you. And you repaid that trust with betrayal, and then cowardice as you ran rather than face judgement for your actions."\n\nThe thestral saw sparks in the alicorn's eyes. They seemed on the edge of bursting into flames, as did the very air around him. "And now you return here, hiding behind others for your safety. My sister despised cowards. Your presence insults her memory, as did the presence of your kind on Zebrica. The only reason you are still alive is because the hippogriffs refused to let you be tried here for treason."\n\nThey were hoof-to-hoof now, Carrot Stick sitting with his back against the wall as the monarch towered over him. "Many of you are buried here, in the fields of Equestria. I would like nothing more than for you to join them." Princess Skystar's voice sounded from somewhere behind the Princess, and Carrot's eyes darted from her to the door. "Run, little pony," she said as she stepped aside. "Run to your guardians, and remember you are not welcome here. I have not forgiven you for your crimes, nor will I for long after you are dead."\n\nCarrot Stick fled, his hooves barely touching the floor until he was safely back by Skystar's side cowering. He had remembered seeing Luna's sister long ago, during his deployment in the Hoof. She had been a kind monarch, always concerned for his well-being and treating everypony with a gentle hoof.\n\nThat mare was not Celestia. Carrot did not know who she was. And those eyes... he would see them always, in his nightmares."
