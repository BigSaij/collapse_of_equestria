 cookhouse.1.t:0 "Aftermath"
 cookhouse.1.d:0 ""Princess Twilight!" The voice rang out in the dead of night, waking two ponies from their half-slumber. Both the alicorn and Sunset Shimmer looked up bleary-eyed from the papers on the table to find Prince Blueblood already in front of them, waiting impatiently in what looked like his night clothes. He eyed the latter with no small amount of disdain before continuing. "I have just discovered that Princess Celestia has disappeared from Canterlot, and no one saw fit to inform me."\n\n"I..." Twilight sputtered for a moment. "None of us were sure of what happened at first. Sunset and I decided-"\n\n"Of course," Blueblood interrupted, snarling. "The two students, working together as always." He turned his attention to the field marshal glaring back at him. "I must congratulate you, Shimmer, for finally getting what you've always wanted. At long last, my aunt has finally been pushed off her throne. Tell me, do you feel satisfied?" Twilight opened her mouth to reply.\n\n"Don't bother," Sunset said, staring daggers right back at the prince. "He could never accept that Celestia was more devoted to us instead of him. Isn't that right?"\n\nBlueblood's normally controlled demeanor broke completely into a mask of pure fury. "You do not get to judge me," he seethed. "I was here long before either of you dreamed of being in this castle. You have no idea what it was like, living the life of a lie hoping that she would notice you again one day. I had hoped she had learned from one student betraying her, but no. How did it feel, Shimmer, knowing you were replaceable too?"\n\n"Blueblood, that is enough." Twilight firmly extended a hoof to hold Sunset back. "Celestia leaving has affected all of us."\n\nThe prince laughed. "And what would you know about her?" he challenged, taking another step towards the princess standing by the stained-glass windows. "She had to be the perfect teacher for you. You have no idea who she really was when it was just the two of us!" He bared his teeth. "Before you and Shimmer and-"\n\nBlueblood finally noticed the streak of moonlight illuminating the papers on the table and turned his snarl to the window. The Mare in the Moon stared back, hauntingly beautiful and uncomfortably familiar. Twilight and Sunset watched as all the color slowly drained out of Blueblood's face, leaving his normally pristine white closer to a deathly pale. "I..." he stopped, emotionless. "I believe I need time alone. My apologies."\n\nThe two mares looked at each other with confusion etched on their muzzles as Blueblood quickly hurried away, vanishing into the darkened halls of the palace."

 cookhouse.2.t:0 "Sunflowers"
 cookhouse.2.d:0 "There was once a farm on the edge of Equestria. The old owners had been wanting to move to the east coast for a long time, so it had been up for sale for a few months prior. Now, it was run by a new unicorn named Sunny Days. She was a newcomer, having appeared out of nowhere and mostly staying to the dilapidated farmhouse. Curiously, the only things she grew in her fields were sunflowers, which she would sometimes offer to the rare pony trotting the dirt road which trailed along the farmland.\n\nUsually the ponies she saw were the rough rural types. That was what she found one day as a dirty white unicorn came trotting along, a heavy dirt blonde beard obscuring his lower muzzle. Judging by the faded uniform, he seemed to be a veteran from the army. "Would you like a sunflower?" she asked politely as he approached, weariness obvious in his trot and expression. His eyes, however, studied her closely as if they were looking for something.\n\n"You know," he finally began, turning his attention to the flowers in the field, "I hated your students at first. I missed the time we spent together, years ago. Back when things felt simple."\n\nSunny Days bowed her head and returned to her sunflowers. She had hoped leaving would have made it easier on him than trying to explain, but if this was what he needed to move on, then she would take whatever he needed to throw at her. Then she would go back to being alone again.\n\n"...the other ponies here told me your name was Sunny Days. I see you've gotten at least a little better at acting. Funny, there's a million things I wanted to say, and yet... Perhaps the best way to start is to apologize." Sunny blinked but did not look at him, instead continuing to tend to her sunflowers.\n\n"I told myself that they would never understand the pain I felt at losing you. At watching you slip away. But only now do I realize that it was I who could never understand your pain. The countless nights you must have spent looking up at the moon. The nights you spend now, even after casting aside the crown."\n\nBlueblood turned to leave. "Twilight was right," he finally admitted. "I can see that clearly now. And I still have my duties to Equestria to fulfill. But someday, when I hang up my uniform for the last time, I will come back here. You don't have to be alone for this. Forgive me for being so selfish."\n\nAfter sparing one last look behind him, Blueblood began trotting away. Sunny Days merely watched from the edge of her field while he disappeared out of sight. Only then did a few tears fall from her eyes, as she whispered, "Oh, Blueblood. I already have.""

 cookhouse.3.t:0 "Best Laid Plans"
 cookhouse.3.d:0 "Rainbow Dash wasn't exactly sure how long she had been held at the makeshift Solarist prison. A few weeks, if she had to guess. At one point she had considered marking down the days in her cell, but that would have implied that she expected to stay there for a long time. And Rainbow 'Danger' Dash never stayed in one place for long. In fact, she was breaking out of here tonight.\n\n...As long as the Lunarists would stop being such a pain in her flank about it.\n\n"Remind me again why we have to do all the dangerous parts of this plan?" Sharp Shadow questioned, eyebrow raised as the other thestrals near him eyed Rainbow with suspicion. "We may be willing to give our lives bringing down the Sun Tyrant, but only for the Nightmare. Not for your outdated notions of harmony or friendship."\n\nAnd there it was again. That question was like the broken clock that nopony cared about in the Wonderbolt Academy break room. Rainbow sighed as she repeated the same response she had for the past week. "You guys are way better at seeing in the dark and avoiding capture than any of us even without your wings," she replied, keeping her voice level. "Once we find the keys to the chains keeping our wings bound, we'll wait for you to loop back around before all flying out together."\n\n"So that you can take us right back to your own prison, right?"\n\n"All of us will still be unarmed," the pegasus patiently reminded Sharp. "If you want to try and capture me for Nightmare Moon, go ahead. But I think we can both agree that it would be a better idea to try it after we're away from the Solarists." Rainbow Dash sighed, feeling the enchanted metal chafe against her one wing. If she still had her prosthetic, this whole prison escape would be so much easier. "Look, I promise we're not going to betray you. And as the Element of Loyalty, I take those pretty seriously."\n\nThe thestrals didn't seem very moved. "We'll see," Sharp Shadow finally said, turning to leave. "Should the Nightmare will it... we will help in this escape from the soldiers of the Sun Tyrant."\n\nIt wasn't a better response than the past week of negotiations. Still, it would have to do. The prison break was planned for tonight, and Rainbow Dash would rather eat dirt than let the countless innocents and dissidents here down."

 cookhouse.4.t:0 "Where It All Goes Wrong"
 cookhouse.4.d:0 ""Where are they?" Rainbow tapped her hoof impatiently against the floor as she and the other Equestrians waited in the office for the thestrals to arrive. The various manacles and enchanted chains keeping their wings bounds were all piled in a corner, and she could tell that a few ponies were already getting antsy about getting out of here. But she had made a promise to the Lunarists, and nopony here was going to leave without her. She was the whole reason they had gotten this far, anyway.\n\nMinutes passed as the clock ticked onwards. This was taking too long. Rainbow was starting to debate whether she should just leave the keys on the table when the door finally opened. "Finally!" she exclaimed as the thestrals trotted in. "I could have made it to Cloudsdale and back with how long you-"\n\nThe pegasus froze. All of them were armed. And Sharp Shadow was aiming a revolver right at her head. "Keys," he said coldly, motioning for the ring of them on the desk nearby. "Did you really think we'd just let you go after this? The Nightmare has made it clear that you and the Element Bearers are her highest priority. Now, you will follow us and behave or-"\n\nA shot rang out, and a thestral slumped to the ground, blood leaking from his head.\n\nThe room erupted into utter chaos as the Solarist guards started swarming into the room, shooting both Lunarist and harmonist alike. Rainbow Dash took cover behind a table with a few other earth ponies, cursing until she noticed a gleam of metal nearby. One of the lockers had fallen over, revealing her confiscated prosthetic wing gleaming from the moonlight through a nearby window. One of the earth ponies saw it too; he lunged forward to slide it back towards the table, right before getting shot twice through the head.\n\n"Quick, get it on!" Rainbow hissed to the two ponies left as they fit it into the metal socket still on her left back. As soon as she felt the magical reconnection, she raised it skyward and watched the sharp metal slice right through a charging thestral above them who slammed into the wall.\n\nRainbow looked at the window nearby. It looked like it could barely fit her, much less anypony else she could carry. The earth ponies seemed to notice that too. "Just get out of here!" one of them said. "Go to Fillydelphia and get help! We'll be fine!" She hesitated for a moment, then nodded and quickly launched herself skyward, bursting through the glass and out into the night sky."
 cookhouse.4.a:0 "The echoes of gunfire quickly ceased behind her."
 
 cookhouse.5.t:0 "Too Little, Too Late"
 cookhouse.5.d:0 "Night was fading away. The moon was slowly falling across the horizon, signaling that day was almost ready to break once again. From a nearby hill, Rainbow Dash looked down into the campgrounds, easily able to see the groups of ponies being herded into lines by worn Solarist soldiers. She noted that there were much fewer thestrals than before, and many more bodies being piled away in a pit they had dug nearby. It seemed that the harmonists were much more willing to surrender than the Lunarist counterparts.\n\nThere had to be a way to free them. Rainbow had found a gun during her escape, and it still had quite a bit of ammunition left in it. Not enough to clear the camp, but if she aimed her shots well it could probably open enough gaps for the prisoners to find their own. Fillydelphia was too far; there was no way she could make it there and back in time to free them, even with her speed.\n\nSomething was happening. A few uniformed Solarists marched back to a sharply-dressed uniform, likely the officer in charge. There was a few seconds of discussion, then one of them pointed outside the camp, in the direction of Rainbow Dash. She ducked just in case they had somehow seen her, but the mare doubted it by how the officer was throwing their hat on the ground in clear frustration. He then pointed at the prisoners left in line.\n\nThere was the sound of countless gunshots. Then every single pony in line fell to the ground, blood pooling around them. It only took a few seconds for the soldiers to start gathering their bodies to take them to the dump pit.\n\nRainbow's blood went cold. That was it. Just like that, every single pony that had helped her escape was gone. She could still remember the fear in their eyes back in the office, when they were waiting to all leave together. Could they have made it out if she had just given permission. Would they still be alive if she just wasn't there at all? Some of them had seemed so confident in her, telling her that they were honored to be with an Element of Harmony. Was this their punishment for that?\n\nThe pegasus turned away. There was nothing left for her here. She readied her wings before launching herself skyward, leaving a sonic rainboom in her wake. At this point, she didn't care about being seen. Nothing would be able to catch up anyway.\n\nThe guilt, though, that was already with her."

 cookhouse.6.t:0 "A Fool Fears Change..."
 cookhouse.6.d:0 ""...and with a Flim-Flam designed industrial mobile cooler, we expect at least a forty eight percent increase to the preservation rate of annual harvests. All of this and more can be installed at a moment's notice, if you would just sign here and put initials here!"\n\nApplejack took the clipboard from Flim's magic and barely glanced at the paper before writing her name in pen on the dotted line. The two brothers stared slack-jawed at each other before clearing their throats. "Well, that was certainly fast. I have to say Applejack, when you called us over to Sweet Apple Acres we thought you were trying to pull something over on us, considering that, well..."\n\n"Well, that we haven't always been entirely honest with you or the rest of Ponyville," Flam finished, staring suspiciously at the farmmare.\n\nApplejack sighed, setting the signed documents down and shifting uncomfortably from side to side. "I know I ain't the smartest of ponies," she finally admitted, her voice betraying difficulty in finding the right words. "I could get some fancy types like Twilight to look over this and make sure you two ain't up to any schemes. But after working together during the war, with y'all being mostly honest the whole time, I figure I can give you at least this much trust once."\n\n"But what about Sweet Apple Acres?" Flam pressed on, his mustache twitching. "Surely it must be difficult for you to give up your way of doing things?"\n\n"Oh it sure as Celestia is," Applejack confirmed, nodding. "Your fancy machines still stir up all kinds of feelings in my head. I even had nightmares of all my friends and I getting replaced by machine versions of ourselves! But after talking with Luna in my dreams, I realized that I was seeing everything wrong." The earth pony looked past the pair of unicorns into the distance, where rows upon rows of apple trees stood across endless fields. "I was scared of everything about the future. Worried that one day, those things you made would make me obsolete one day. But they're just tools, and it's ponies like me that decide how to use them. Fighting change ain't gonna accomplish anything, so I might as well make sure it happens in a way that benefits everypony... even you two."\n\nThe brothers were stunned into silence. Flim was the first to recover, lightly coughing into a hoof. "Well, my dear Applejack, my brother and I must admit we learned a thing or two from you as well," he said, voice surprisingly honest. "And you have our sincere promise that this time, the two of us will be real partners with your family."\n\n"Our schemes were getting nowhere anyway," Flam added. "We'd rather build something legitimate now, something that'll last!"\n\nApplejack smiled. "You know you two, I think things might work out between us after all.""
