 cookhouse.1.d:0 ""Princess Twilight!" Both the alicorn and Sunset Shimmer looked up from the papers on the table, finding Prince Blueblood already in front of them waiting impatiently. He eyed the latter with no small amount of disdain before continuing. "I have just discovered that Princess Celestia has disappeared from Canterlot, and no one saw fit to inform me of this."\n\n"I..." Twilight sputtered for a moment, unsure how to explain. "None of us were sure of what happened at first, Blueblood. Sunset and I decided it would be better to avoid any further panic until we can deal with-"\n\n"Of course," Blueblood interrupted, snarling. "The two students, working together as always." He turned his attention to the field marshal glaring back at him. "I must congratulate you, Shimmer, for finally getting what you've always wanted. At long last, my aunt has finally been pushed off her throne. Tell me, do you feel satisfied yet?"\n\n"Blueblood! Do we really have to do this in the middle of the night?"\n\n"Don't bother, Twilight," Sunset said, staring daggers right back at the prince. "He could never get over the time Celestia devoted to us instead of him. Isn't that right?"\n\nThe mare's provocation worked perfectly; Blueblood's normally controlled demeanor broke completely into a mask of pure fury. "You do not get to judge me," he seethed. "I was here long before either of you dreamed of being in this castle. Do either of you have any idea what it was like, living the life of a lie hoping that she would notice you again one day? I had hoped she had learned from one student betraying her, but no. How did it feel, Shimmer, knowing you were replaceable?"\n\n"Blueblood, that is enough." Twilight firmly extended a hoof to hold Sunset back. "Celestia leaving has affected all of us. This is no excuse for you to act like-"\n\nThe prince laughed. "And what would you know about her?" he challenged, taking another step towards the princess. "She had to be nothing but the perfect teacher for you. You have no idea what she was like back then when it was just the two of us, before you and Shimmer and-"\n\nA streak of moonlight broke through the nearby window, causing Blueblood to look up into the night sky. The image of the Mare in the Moon was clearly imprinted upon its surface, hauntingly beautiful and uncomfortably familiar. Twilight and Sunset watched as all the color slowly drained out of Blueblood's face, leaving his normally pristine white closer to a deathly pale. "I..." he stuttered, all emotion lost from his voice. "I believe I need time alone. My apologies."\n\nThe two mares looked at each other with confusion etched on their muzzles as Blueblood quickly hurried away, disappearing into the halls of the castle."

 cookhouse.2.t:0 "Sunflowers"
 cookhouse.2.d:0 "On the edges of western Equestria, there was a farm. The old owners had been wanting to move to the east coast for a long time, so it had been up for sale for a few months prior. Now, it was run by a new unicorn named Sunny Days. She was a newcomer, having appeared out of nowhere one day and mostly staying to the farmhouse which looked like it had seen better days. Curiously, the only thing she seemed to grow in her fields was sunflowers, which she would sometimes offer to the rare pony trotting the dirt road which trailed along the farmland.\n\nUsually the ponies she saw were the rough rural types. That was what she found one day as a dirty white unicorn came trotting along, a heavy beard obscuring his lower muzzle. Judging by the look, he seemed to be a veteran from the army. "Would you like a sunflower?" she asked politely as he approached, weariness obvious in his trot and expression. His eyes, however, studied her closely as if they were looking for something.\n\n"You know," he finally began, turning his attention to the flowers in the field, "I hated your students at first. I missed the time we spent together, years ago. Back when things felt simple and peaceful."\n\nIt was him. She almost didn't recognize him, with how much he had changed. She had hoped leaving would have made it easier on him than trying to explain, but if this was what he needed to move on, then she would take whatever he needed to throw at her. Then she would go back to being alone again.\n\n"...the other ponies here told me your name was Sunny Days. I see you've gotten at least a little better at acting. Funny, how there is a million things I want to say, and yet almost no way for me to tell you. Perhaps the best way to start is to apologize."\n\nSunny blinked. "I told myself that they would never understand the pain I felt at losing you. At watching you slip away with the time we spent together. But only now do I realize that it was I who could never understand your pain. The countless nights you must have spent looking up at the moon, waiting for her to come back. It's the same pain you must feel now, even after casting aside the crown."\n\nBlueblood adjusted his clothes, seemingly preparing to leave. "Twilight was right," he finally admitted as he turned to leave. "I can see that clearly now. And I still have my duties to Equestria to fulfill. But someday, when I hang up my uniform for the last time, I will come back here to find you. You don't have to be alone for this, you know. I just hope you can forgive me for being so selfish."\n\nAfter sparing one last look behind him, Blueblood began trotting away. Sunny Days merely watched from the edge of her field as he continued along the road, eventually disappearing out of sight. Only then did a few tears fall from her eyes, as she whispered, "Oh, Blueblood. I already have.""
