 TMP_tempest_shadow:0 "Tempest Shadow"
 TMP_tempest_shadow_desc:0 "Tempest Shadow was born Fizzlepop Berrytwist, a unicorn in a small village within the western outskirts of Equestria. Talented with magic and holding dreams of attending the School for Gifted Unicorns in Canterlot alongside her friends Glitter Drops and Spring Rain, those dreams were shattered alongside her horn after an encounter with an ursa minor. Feeling betrayed by her friends after they abandoned her and left for Canterlot, Fizzlepop journeyed off out of Equestria southwards, seeking her place in a world that rejected her.\n\nAfter finding an artifact known as the Misfortune Malachite, Fizzlepop was confronted personally by the Storm King and given an offer; a position within his army as a Lieutenant and his new second-in-command, as well as a promise to fix her horn, in return for her total loyalty. She agreed, and shed off her old identity to become Tempest Shadow.\n\nShe served the Storm King faithfully for many moons, earning the respect of the storm creatures under her command and helping him conquer countless places with only one failure; the invasion of Hippogriffia, where Queen Novo was able to successfully escape with the Pearl of Transformation. It was Tempest who led the attack on Canterlot, and her who chased Princess Twilight and her friends across the lands south of Equestria culminating in her capture. But when the time came, she was betrayed by the Storm King, and switched sides to help Twilight destroy the mad tyrant.\n\nTempest temporarily took back her old name as she sought to refind her place in Equestria, rekindling friendships old and new. But once the Twilight Secession began and rumors spread that one on Storm Island was seeking to revive her old master, she knew that only she could stop this threat. Arriving with a few friends in tow and commanding her old storm creature subordinates by force, she is determined to prevent the return of the Storm King by any means necessary."
 TMP_fizzlepop_berrytwist:0 "Fizzlepop Berrytwist"
 TMP_grubber:0 "Grubber" #gotta rewrite this one
 #TMP_grubber_desc:0 "Grubber is not what most would consider a tactical mind in any sort of sense, conventional or otherwise. In fact for much of his 'career' in the Storm Army, he was kept as far away a position of real command as possible and was relegated to the unimportant mundane tasks fit for a small creature such as himself. While things did slightly improve after he self-assigned himself to being Tempest Shadow's unofficial sidekick, much to her annoyance, any authority he had came from his sociable nature with the other Storm Creatures who considered him one of their own, and the expectation that Tempest Shadow herself was the one behind his orders.\n\nAfter the destruction of the Storm King Grubber did not stay with Tempest, instead returning back to the Storm Island alongside the rest of the shattered and disorganized army. There he shifted from village to village, fleeing from the constant violence between petty warlords that had sprung up in the absence of real authority. When Tempest came back he quickly returned to her side, and in turn became an essential part of convincing storm creatures to rally under her banner. Due to his importance as the link between her and her soldiers, Grubber became a military commander in essence, if not by official title.\n\nThe hedgehog is unfocused, inexperienced and a creature of words rather than action; at first glance, a rather poor choice for a leader in an army. However, Grubber has learned more from Tempest than even he consciously knows, and his loyalty and devotion to her is unquestionable. With some proper training he may yet become a true commander, especially given his ability to convince the storm creatures to follow his orders and take his advice without question."
 TMP_glitter_drops:0 "Glitter Drops"
 TMP_glitter_drops_general_desc:0 "A long time ago, Glitter Drops was just a young unicorn filly like any other, playing with her peers somewhere far in western Equestria. Together, she dreamed with her friends of attending the School for Gifted Unicorns, and improving her magic to be one of the best mages in the land. But all of that began to crumble away the day Fizzlepop Berrytwist ventured into a cave during a game of ball and lost her horn to the ursa minor.\n\nGlitter Drops was still accepted to the School of Gifted Unicorns with her friend, Spring Rain, but found that the curriculum was too difficult to keep up with. Despite her natural talent as illusion spells, she eventually dropped out and sought work first maintaining the Everfree Forest, and then as part of the Arctic Patrol in the Crystal Empire. There she met a reformed Tempest Shadow, who reconciled with her after being saved from an ursa minor.\n\nGlitter Drops continued her exceptional service patrolling the outskirts of the Crystal Empire up until the Twilight Secession. Once Equestria began falling apart, she received a letter from Fizzlepop Berrytwist, asking for help in defeating a rising threat to all ponykind on Storm Island. Feeling an obligation to her friend, she quickly gave up her post and traveled alongside Fizzlepop, becoming the de facto leader of the Equestrians who now make up an important part of Tempest's operations. And while she is happy to help stop the threat of a new Storm King, Glitter Drops can not help but wonder if Fizzlepop is slipping away again, or dream of one day returning home to Equestria..."

 TMP_between_two_worlds_desc:0 "The storm creatures know me as Tempest Shadow. The Equestrians know me as Fizzlepop Berrytwist. Am I either one of those ponies anymore? I don't know, but what I do know is that I'll need the help of both storm creatures and ponies to stop this idiot who wants the Storm King back. But time is running out, and we need to be fast."
 TMP_an_old_life:0 "An Old Life"
 TMP_an_old_life_desc:0 "It's been a long time since I've been a commander of storm creatures, and the experience doesn't exactly bring up any pleasant memories. One thing I do remember well though is their ability to fight, to wage war and take orders without question. They will be the army I need to take control of this island, as long as I can win their loyalty."
 TMP_drill_troops:0 "Drill The Troops"
 TMP_drill_troops_desc:0 "As time runs out, so too does my window of opportunity to prepare for the inevitable conflict with the remnants of the Storm Kingdom. The training we have accomplished so far is not enough; they must have more. Only perfection is the bare minimum that can be expected."
 TMP_tactics_and_strategy:0 "Of Tactics And Strategy"
 TMP_tactics_and_strategy_desc:0 "To secure total victory, I must hold the advantage in every aspect of war. The most important of these, even moreso than technologies or the size of armies, is strategy; something that most of the storm creatures sorely lack. Fortunately, when it comes to war they are eager students, and I am all too willing to be their teacher."
 TMP_open_armories:0 "Open The Armories"
 TMP_open_armories_desc:0 "Across this island are many hidden weapon and armor stashes, kept in case the island was ever invaded while the Storm King was on one of his campaigns. While I certainly appreciate a good contingency plan, those weapons are needed now more than ever. Let us put them to their proper use destroying my enemies."
 TMP_show_strength:0 "A Show Of Strength"
 TMP_show_strength_desc:0 "The best way to keep storm creatures in line is to show them strength. Not necessarily physical strength; victories using underhooved methods and deception win just as much respect as that of brute force. With a few of my 'subjects' recently acting out of line, I think it's time I remind them why I was the Storm King's lieutenant in the first place."
 TMP_some_older_friends:0 "Some Older Friends"
 TMP_some_older_friends_desc:0 "I wasn't sure what to think when Glitter Drops said she was coming to this island alongside me. The help she and the Equestrians she managed to sway to my cause have given however is undeniable. I owe them a lot, and with their help we might turn this little adventure into something more than just another conquest."
 TMP_settle_diaspora:0 "Settle The Diaspora"
 TMP_settle_diaspora_desc:0 "Many ponies came here simply because they had nowhere else to go now that Equestria has utterly collapsed. We're a more resilent race than we appear, though, and most are now seeking to find new lives here, on this foreign and hostile island. The least we can do is offer our support in helping them settle into new homes and communities."
 TMP_courage_ponykind:0 "The Courage Of Ponykind"
 TMP_courage_ponykind_desc:0 "Once, I saw Equestrians and my own kind as pacifistic and idealistic cowards, too tied up in the ideals of friendship to put up a fight. Time and time was I proven wrong, as ponies stood up to defend themselves and harmony from those who would threaten it. These volunteers will now be a critical part of my efforts to take this island."
 TMP_loyalty_to_princess:0 "Loyalty To The Princess"
 TMP_loyalty_to_princess_desc:0 "Much of Equestria broke away from Canterlot due to self-guided and selfish interests by ponies who have forsaken harmony. We however are here to fulfill a duty, and though we have traveled far all of us remember the teachings of Princess Twilight. No matter what happens we will be loyal to Equestria. and everything we do is for our home."
 TMP_show_friendship:0 "A Show Of Friendship"
 TMP_show_friendship_desc:0 "Ponies are becoming unsettled by some of the things I do as Tempest Shadow. While they do not need to understand that what I do is necessary for all of us to survive on this island, something to assure them that I still remember the lessons of Equestria may be prudent. Perhaps a festival of friendship would do them well."
 TMP_deals_and_appeals:0 "Deals And Appeals"
 TMP_deals_and_appeals_desc:0 "While my authority over my soldiers may be absolute, the same cannot be said for many of the Equestrians who came with me, or the storm creatures whose lands I now control. Unfortunately, that means I have to do one of my least favorite things; negotiation. Even worse, it is unlikely that I can bring both to the table..."
 TMP_rein_in_equestrians:0 "Rein In The Equestrians"
 TMP_rein_in_equestrians_desc:0 "While the work done by my fellow Equestrians is necessary, their attitude and dismissiveness for the storm creatures and traditions is not. We are no longer in Equestria anymore, and I can not afford to have my army at odds due to some so-called scientists. I will get them under control, one way or another."
 TMP_full_speed_ahead:0 "Full Speed Ahead"
 TMP_full_speed_ahead_desc:0 "The lands of Equestria and beyond continue to advance into the future despite its disintegration, and my army can not afford to fall behind the curve. We need every advantage we can get, and if the other Equestrians can give us one, then I must give them all the resources and authority they need regardless of storm creature objections."
 TMP_second_in_command:0 "The Second-In-Commmand"
 TMP_second_in_command_desc:0 "A chain of command is essential to any functioning army. Without one, you might as well call yourself the leader of a mob. Until now I had refrained from naming a second, to try and keep the peace between storm creatures and ponies, but that clearly has not worked. Now, I am left with task of deciding who shall be what I once was."
 TMP_uphold_storm_legacy:0 "Uphold The Legacy"
 TMP_uphold_storm_legacy_desc:0 "The Equestrians may not like to remember it, but the fact is that I was the Storm King's top lieutenant, and the one to command his armies in his name. That time may be long gone, but the soldiers remember. I was the closest thing to an heir he had, and though I want to be nothing like him they will follow who they call their leader. So let that leader be me."
 TMP_beacon_new_ideals:0 "A Beacon Of Ideals"
 TMP_beacon_new_ideals_desc:0 "The necessity of victory may be great, but I cannot lower myself to the level of my enemies. The Storm King brought nothing but tyranny, and we are here to build something better. With us the memory of Equestria and its values will live on, and so too will harmony itself, with us Equestrians as its guardians."
 TMP_eye_of_storm:0 "In The Eye Of The Storm"
 TMP_eye_of_storm_desc:0 "Preparations are complete, and soon it will be time to launch a final assault on the Storm Kingdom and end the threat of the Storm King's return for good. Everything rests on this pivotal moment, and the ability to press our advantage is crucial to our survival. All the storm creatures wait for is my command."
 
 
 ### IDEAS ###
 TMP_illegitimate_government:0 "Illegitimate Government"
 TMP_illegitimate_government_desc:0 "The lands Tempest Shadow controls are not so much a state or even a government as much as an army occupying land. The term 'Tempest Realm' is not even official, and is more of a name the Storm Creatures have taken to calling any territory occupied by Commander Tempest's forces. This total lack of government, while devoid of any red tape or bureaucratic complexity, does raise many issues for long-term stability and local conscription."
 TMP_professional_army:0 "Professional Army"
 TMP_professional_army_desc:0 "The army led personally by Commander Tempest is one that is highly trained, drilled, and instilled within it absolute discipline. The storm creatures, already obedient creatures have risen up to her expectations of total loyalty, creating a force more effective than perhaps any other in the world. This discipline does not come without downsides however, and the army is limited in size and organization as not many can pass Tempest's harsh standards."
 TMP_equestrian_technological_monopoly:0 "Equestrian Technological Monopoly"
 TMP_equestrian_technological_monopoly_desc:0 "The storm creatures, for all their strength and power, are not exactly known for being the smartest creatures in the world. As such, practically all research and development is left to the few Equestrian exiles who followed Tempest to Storm Island, giving them a total monopoly on technological advancements. Their small number and limited resources mean they can only do so much, and even with their slow progress some storm creatures feel resentment at their perceived arrogance and demands."

 ### EVENTS ###
 tempest.1.t:0 "Gathering Stormclouds"
 tempest.1.d:0 ""Wow, what a day, huh? I mean, basically every day is like this now, and like, I was totally into how you absolutely destroyed that ambush earlier, but I'm starting to run out of sponge cake and you know how I get when I-"\n\n"Grubber."\n\n"Right, sorry."\n\nTempest Shadow closed her eyes and took a deep breath before returning her attention to the map in front of her. She knew the Storm Island well; it had been the closest thing to a home for a good part of her life. Here she had trained relentlessly in the mountains to grow stronger, all to one day regain what was taken from her. And now, after countless moons of subjugation campaigns under the Storm King's banner and subsequent soul-searching in Equestria, she was back.\n\n"Some of the guys are asking me when we're gonna go out and beat that poser," her hedgehog sidekick continued from behind her. "Personally, you know how much I like being here instead of out there, but that Storm Prince loser is getting stronger every day and losing a fight is not a good look for me. Uh, I mean us."\n\n"I am well aware of that, Grubber," Tempest replied. "Tell them to expect a war within the year. Glitter Drops is still working on finding more Equestrians to help."\n\nGrubber waddled up to sit on one of the stools strewn throughout the room. "Yeah, I don't think they'll be too happy about that either. I get that she's your friend and all that, but whenever she tries to give orders to the others it does not go well, let me tell you." The commander didn't offer a response. "Tempest? Hello?"\n\nTempest wasn't listening. Instead, she focused on the shard of stone next to the map. He had been a true tyrant, eccentric but cold and calculating enough to almost destroy Equestria once. She couldn't let it happen again. "Grubber, you're dismissed," she said, her voice hard. "I'll see you at dawn tomorrow."\n\nShe had to do this. She had to win, no matter what it took. Her friends, Princess Twilight, all of Equestria was counting on her even if they didn't know it yet.\n\nHer horn sparked with energy, burning a hole through the map where the old Storm Fortress was. It was time to go."
 tempest.1.a:0 "We can't afford to waste a single day."
 
 tempest.2.t:0 "The Right Hoof"
 tempest.2.d:0 "Tempest watched as the commander gave a gruff shout, signaling the start of the next training matches. Storm creatures below began fighting, some dueling with shield and blunted spears in hand; others with dark metal staffs firing blasts of magical electricity at storm creatures wielding massive two-handed spellshields. The victors would return to the barracks with all the amenities a struggling semi-state in the middle of nowhere could afford its army; the losers would be up until midnight maintaining the camp for the others. Society here was always centered around the strong commanding the weak; Tempest saw no issue in it, as long as it gave her results.\n\n"So, who do you think is gonna win?" Grubber asked, pointing to two storm creatures with spears locked in close quarters.\n\n"Does it matter?"\n\n"Well, no," the sidekick admitted, "but the guys have a lot of bets on it. There's gonna be a lot of storm bucks moving around tonight."\n\nThe mare rolled her eyes before settling her attention back on the fights below. "I'm glad you're here, Grubber," she said out of nowhere, surprising the small hedgehog. "How well do you know the soldiers down there?"\n\nGrubber looked down at the trainees. To most ponies, even to Tempest herself, the storm creatures looked identical past any weapons or armor identifying their rank or status. To Grubber, though, there was real recognition in those eyes. "Well some of them are pretty new," he admitted, "but I go way back with most of these guys. I think a few were even with us in Canterlot."\n\nAnd they talk to you about all their issues?"\n\n"Yeah, but only while they're on break. No offense, but they don't consider you the most approachable leader ever."\n\n"I know." Tempest suddenly bent down, lowering her neck to get closer to eye level with Grubber. He tried not to flinch. "That's why I need your help. The storm creatures follow me because they respect me, but that may not last. I need you to keep an eye on them for me and let me know what I need to do to keep them loyal. Can you do that for me?"\n\nThe hedgehog gave as close to a salute as he could manage. "Got it, Tempest! Though, uh, a few drinks would definitely help with that if you have the chance. They're actually very talkative once they loosen up, I mean there was this one time back in Abyssinia...""
 tempest.2.a:0 "With their loyalty comes an army like no other."
 
 tempest.3.t:0 "In The Borderlands"
 tempest.3.d:0 "There was no clearly defined border in the Thunder Mountains that marked the end of lands Tempest nominally controlled and the start of land hostile to her loyalists. There was a vague feeling of in what places wearing a certain color would get you killed, and the northern coastline was much more defined with the small settlement at Endridge Port, but in general few storm creatures recognized the notion of two states on their home island. There were loyalists, and there were traitors. It was as simple as that.\n\nLoyalty, however, that was difficult here. One could not expect storm creatures to fight on like partisans after territory was lost. If you had to surrender a village to an enemy, then that just proved you were too weak to defend them and didn't deserve the village in the first place. Such was why Tempest Shadow had taken it on herself to personally lead the latest border patrol through the mountains, to ensure the soldiers of the Storm Prince were not encroaching on their already-limited area of control.\n\n"So, I don't mean to make you reconsider this choice," Grubber said as the two made their way up the narrow trail winding across the mountainside, "but you never let me ride on your back. Are you sure about this?"\n\n"Would you have come with me otherwise?"\n\n"No, because I know I said I would start hiking but I figured out that I get cramps if I walk for too long, and I will get stuck somewhere in the middle of nowhere. That still doesn't tell me why you want me here, though." Grubber gulped as Tempest's eyes narrowed. "No offense-"\n\nIn one swift movement, the unicorn reared up to force the hedgehog off before turning and effortlessly kicking a storm creature with both hind legs. Landing a few hoofsteps away, the old colors of the Storm King were still visible on his armor. "Defensive positions!" Tempest commanded to the soldiers behind her who locked shields. "Ambush!"\n\nAs the loyalists got into position, Tempest looked back at Grubber for a moment and he swore she was barely supressing a grin. "Did you know this was gonna happen?" he asked, making sure he was behind the defensive parameter being set up.\n\nShe winked. "Maybe. And when I win, I'm sure you'll tell everyone back at camp about how I beat them, right?" Tempest didn't wait for a response, immediately jumping into combat with more enemy storm creature appearing from the nearby ridge. Grubber thought for a moment, then started clapping his hands in excitement.\n\n"Ooh, this is gonna be good. Hit 'em, commander!""
 tempest.3.a:0 "The victory was the talk of the army that night."
 
 tempest.4.t:0 "A Ray of Friendship"
 tempest.4.d:0 ""Fizzy!" Glitter Drops gently dropped the clipboard in her magic onto the table before trotting over to give Tempest a hug. Normally she would hate the use of her old nickname and such public displays of friendship, especially on this island, but for one of her oldest friends she could make an exception. As long as there were no storm creatures to hear or see it, at least.\n\n"Good to see you too, Dropsy," Tempest replied, turning her attention to the other dozen or so ponies going through papers and notebooks. "It looks like things are going well here, at least."\n\nGlitter looked back at her clipboard; Tempest could see a few diagrams drawn on the paper attached of various magical staffs. Some other ones were scribbled out, and there were question marks all over the whole page. "It's a bit hard to remember the lessons at the School for Gifted Unicorns after all these years," the unicorn said looking a bit embarrassed. "They wanted us to learn magical artifacts and what they did, not to help us make our own. It's really surprising that the storm creatures here were able to figure out how to make one that works to begin with."\n\n"You'd be surprised what they can do when they put their mind to it."\n\n"Or how stubborn they can be," Glitter grumbled. "They barely want anything to do with us or our work here. Don't they know we're trying to help them?" Taking a deep breath, the mare closed her eyes for a bit before turning back to Tempest with a renewed smile. "Sorry, I'm just a little frustrated at the moment. Most of us have no experience with weapons in general, much less designing them for creatures that aren't ponies."\n\nThe crackle of electricity turned Tempest's attention to a pair of ponies, one of whom looked visibly injured from magical shock. The other was holding one of the dark magical staffs used by the storm creatures, an expression of utter shock on his muzzle. "I think I can tell," she commented as the injured stallion was led away. "And I know it's hard to be out here, this far away from Equestria. But for what it's worth... I'm glad you're here with me."\n\n"Thanks, Fizzy. And don't worry about me. I let you feel abandoned once, and I'm not going to let that happen again.""
 tempest.4.a:0 "A reforged bond, stronger than ever."
 
 tempest.5.t:0 "Festivals and Fun"
 tempest.5.d:0 "'Little Ponyville', they called it. It was certainly an apt name, given the quaint nature of the village settled on the eastern peninsula of the island. Most storm creatures lived in caves or stone structures easily constructed with their large frames and exceptional strength. While Tempest admired the practicality of their designs, the other ponies had no interest in following suit. Instead they took advantage of the limited fertile land, growing crops and erecting houses with the small supply of wood and thatch.\n\nDespite being built close by an existing storm creature settlement, the natives seemed to care little for the new district. Whether it was out of a genuine lack of interest or because they knew Tempest would not tolerate explicit infighting, she could not say. Personally she did not spend much time in the pony village, as her duties required her elsewhere in military camps and outposts.\n\nTonight, however, was an exception.\n\n"I wasn't able to go to the Friendship Festival," Glitter Drops said as she and Tempest watched the other ponies celebrate among makeshift decorations. "What was it like?"\n\n"Before or after the Storm Army occupied Canterlot?" she replied humorlessly. "It was... nice. Princess Twilight certainly put a lot of effort into it. A lot like this, but bigger and with more Pinkie Pie." Glitter sighed, and Tempest raised an eyebrow. "Is something wrong?"\n\n"I miss Equestria. And I don't mean the place or anything like that. It just..."\n\n"...Doesn't feel like home anymore," Tempest finished. Glitter nodded, her usually upbeat mood quickly turning depressive. "I haven't had a home in a long time, so maybe I'm not the best pony to take advice from for this. But I think that if Princess Twilight was here, she'd say that home isn't just a place or a name." The unicorn pointed a hoof at the crowd of ponies nearby, who were all raising mugs skyward in a big circle cheering. "It's where your friends are. So maybe... Equestria is right here?" Tempest frowned. "I've never been good with this emotional stuff."\n\nGlitter gave a small smile. "No, you're right," she responded, looking skyward. This far south the moon and stars were in full view, revealing the countless constellations in the night sky. "Maybe we never do leave Equestria, as long as we have friendship.""
 tempest.5.a:0 "An unbroken spirit is as important as any sword."
 
 tempest.6.t:0 "Backroom Negotiating"
 tempest.6.d:0 ""How are things going today, boss?" Grubber shut the door behind him and walked over to his self-designed chair in the corner of Tempest's makeshift office, which she was really starting to regret allowing him to build. She didn't mind his company most of the time, but too much Grubber in a day tended to wear her patience a bit thin. "You want to head down to the market later? I saw some good fish earlier for sale, and you know how fast those things go once word gets around."\n\n"You'll have to go without me. I have an important meeting to attend."\n\nThe hedgehog's eyes narrowed. "No you don't," he responded, his voice suspicious. "Trust me, I triple-checked your schedule this morning and you don't have anything except your exercises. And the last time someone tried doing something unscheduled with you they ended up fried."\n\nTempest sighed, putting down the quill she was writing notes with. "Glitter Drops, Spring Rain and a few other ponies wanted to talk with me privately," she explained as she pushed a few other papers to the side. "They want more ponies here to help with their projects and research, since the storm creatures aren't being of much use there. Opening up the port here would make it safer for potential refugees to come here from Equestria."\n\n"Oh, the guys wouldn't like that," Grubber protested, getting off his chair. "They already aren't a fan of how many ponies you've brought here. You do something like that and they'll never tell you about the gliders."\n\n"The what?"\n\n"I didn't learn about them until last night!" he hastily added as Tempest's icy glare turned on him. "You told me to watch them so I did, and after a few drinks I heard talk of a secret stash of gliders in the mountains. They wouldn't tell me where because they think you're with the ponies too much, though." Grubber put on a face of deep contemplation; a rare sight for many. "But if you rejected Glitter Drops' offer where the guys could see it, I bet they'd probably trust you again!"\n\nTempest's glare disappeared, but her sour expression remained. "Yes, go and betray my oldest friend like that. Really smart decision, Grubber."\n\n"Hey, she'll get over it! I'm just doing what you told me to do. If you still want to go with her plan, then don't let me stop you."\n\nAfter a few seconds of silence, the unicorn's scowl finally disappeared as she sighed and turned back towards her desk. She didn't want to turn her back on Glitter like that, especially not now. But Grubber was probably right, and if those gliders really did exist they could be vital to winning the war.\n\n...Sometimes, she really hated being a leader."
 tempest.6.a:0 ""Sorry, but I've got a meeting with Glitter to get to.""
 tempest.6.b:0 ""Get a crowd, Grubber. Let's make this public.""
