 TMP_tempest_shadow:0 "Tempest Shadow"
 TMP_tempest_shadow_desc:0 "Tempest Shadow was born Fizzlepop Berrytwist, a unicorn in a small village within the western outskirts of Equestria. Talented with magic and holding dreams of attending the School for Gifted Unicorns in Canterlot alongside her friends Glitter Drops and Spring Rain, those dreams were shattered alongside her horn after an encounter with an ursa minor. Feeling betrayed by her friends after they abandoned her and left for Canterlot, Fizzlepop journeyed off out of Equestria southwards, seeking her place in a world that rejected her.\n\nAfter finding an artifact known as the Misfortune Malachite, Fizzlepop was confronted personally by the Storm King and given an offer; a position within his army as a Lieutenant and his new second-in-command, as well as a promise to fix her horn, in return for her total loyalty. She agreed, and shed off her old identity to become Tempest Shadow.\n\nShe served the Storm King faithfully for many moons, earning the respect of the storm creatures under her command and helping him conquer countless places with only one failure; the invasion of Hippogriffia, where Queen Novo was able to successfully escape with the Pearl of Transformation. It was Tempest who led the attack on Canterlot, and her who chased Princess Twilight and her friends across the lands south of Equestria culminating in her capture. But when the time came, she was betrayed by the Storm King, and switched sides to help Twilight destroy the mad tyrant.\n\nTempest temporarily took back her old name as she sought to refind her place in Equestria, rekindling friendships old and new. But once the Twilight Secession began and rumors spread that one on Storm Island was seeking to revive her old master, she knew that only she could stop this threat. Arriving with a few friends in tow and commanding her old storm creature subordinates by force, she is determined to prevent the return of the Storm King by any means necessary."

 TMP_glitter_drops:0 "Glitter Drops"
 TMP_glitter_drops_general_desc:0 "A long time ago, Glitter Drops was just a young unicorn filly like any other, playing with her peers somewhere far in western Equestria. Together, she dreamed with her friends of attending the School for Gifted Unicorns, and improving her magic to be one of the best mages in the land. But all of that began to crumble away the day Fizzlepop Berrytwist ventured into a cave during a game of ball and lost her horn to the ursa minor.\n\nGlitter Drops was still accepted to the School of Gifted Unicorns with her friend, Spring Rain, but found that the curriculum was too difficult to keep up with. Despite her natural talent as illusion spells, she eventually dropped out and sought work first maintaining the Everfree Forest, and then as part of the Arctic Patrol in the Crystal Empire. There she met a reformed Tempest Shadow, who reconciled with her after being saved from an ursa minor.\n\nGlitter Drops continued her exceptional service patrolling the outskirts of the Crystal Empire up until the Twilight Secession. Once Equestria began falling apart, she received a letter from Fizzlepop Berrytwist, asking for help in defeating a rising threat to all ponykind on Storm Island. Feeling an obligation to her friend, she quickly gave up her post and traveled alongside Fizzlepop, becoming the de facto leader of the Equestrians who now make up an important part of Tempest's operations. And while she is happy to help stop the threat of a new Storm King, Glitter Drops can not help but wonder if Fizzlepop is slipping away again, or dream of one day returning home to Equestria..."

 ### FOCI ###
 TMP_between_two_worlds:0 "Between Two Worlds"
 TMP_between_two_worlds_desc:0 "The storm creatures know me as Tempest Shadow. The Equestrians know me as Fizzlepop Berrytwist. Am I either one of those ponies anymore? I don't know, but what I do know is that I'll need the help of both storm creatures and ponies to stop this idiot who wants the Storm King back. But time is running out, and we need to be fast."
 TMP_an_old_life:0 "An Old Life"
 TMP_an_old_life_desc:0 "It's been a long time since I've been a commander of storm creatures, and the experience doesn't exactly bring up any pleasant memories. One thing I do remember well though is their ability to fight, to wage war and take orders without question. They will be the army I need to take control of this island, as long as I can win their loyalty."
 TMP_drill_troops:0 "Drill The Troops"
 TMP_drill_troops_desc:0 "As time runs out, so too does my window of opportunity to prepare for the inevitable conflict with the remnants of the Storm Kingdom. The training we have accomplished so far is not enough; they must have more. Only perfection is the bare minimum that can be expected."
 TMP_tactics_and_strategy:0 "Of Tactics And Strategy"
 TMP_tactics_and_strategy_desc:0 "To secure total victory, I must hold the advantage in every aspect of war. The most important of these, even moreso than technologies or the size of armies, is strategy; something that most of the storm creatures sorely lack. Fortunately, when it comes to war they are eager students, and I am all too willing to be their teacher."
 TMP_open_armories:0 "Open The Armories"
 TMP_open_armories_desc:0 "Across this island are many hidden weapon and armor stashes, kept in case the island was ever invaded while the Storm King was on one of his campaigns. While I certainly appreciate a good contingency plan, those weapons are needed now more than ever. Let us put them to their proper use destroying my enemies."
 TMP_show_strength:0 "A Show Of Strength"
 TMP_show_strength_desc:0 "The best way to keep storm creatures in line is to show them strength. Not necessarily physical strength; victories using underhooved methods and deception win just as much respect as that of brute force. With a few of my 'subjects' recently acting out of line, I think it's time I remind them why I was the Storm King's lieutenant in the first place."
 TMP_some_older_friends:0 "Some Older Friends"
 TMP_some_older_friends_desc:0 "I wasn't sure what to think when Glitter Drops said she was coming to this island alongside me. The help she and the Equestrians she managed to sway to my cause have given however is undeniable. I owe them a lot, and with their help we might turn this little adventure into something more than just another conquest."
 TMP_settle_diaspora:0 "Settle The Diaspora"
 TMP_settle_diaspora_desc:0 "Many ponies came here simply because they had nowhere else to go now that Equestria has utterly collapsed. We're a more resilent race than we appear, though, and most are now seeking to find new lives here, on this foreign and hostile island. The least we can do is offer our support in helping them settle into new homes and communities."
 TMP_courage_ponykind:0 "The Courage Of Ponykind"
 TMP_courage_ponykind_desc:0 "Once, I saw Equestrians and my own kind as pacifistic and idealistic cowards, too tied up in the ideals of friendship to put up a fight. Time and time was I proven wrong, as ponies stood up to defend themselves and harmony from those who would threaten it. These volunteers will now be a critical part of my efforts to take this island."
 TMP_loyalty_to_princess:0 "Loyalty To The Princess"
 TMP_loyalty_to_princess_desc:0 "Much of Equestria broke away from Canterlot due to self-guided and selfish interests by ponies who have forsaken harmony. We however are here to fulfill a duty, and though we have traveled far all of us remember the teachings of Princess Twilight. No matter what happens we will be loyal to Equestria. and everything we do is for our home."
 TMP_show_friendship:0 "A Show Of Friendship"
 TMP_show_friendship_desc:0 "Ponies are becoming unsettled by some of the things I do as Tempest Shadow. While they do not need to understand that what I do is necessary for all of us to survive on this island, something to assure them that I still remember the lessons of Equestria may be prudent. Perhaps a festival of friendship would do them well."

 ### IDEAS ###
 TMP_illegitimate_government:0 "Illegitimate Government"
 TMP_illegitimate_government_desc:0 "The lands Tempest Shadow controls are not so much a state or even a government as much as an army occupying land. The term 'Tempest Realm' is not even official, and is more of a name the Storm Creatures have taken to calling any territory occupied by Commander Tempest's forces. This total lack of government, while devoid of any red tape or bureaucratic complexity, does raise many issues for long-term stability and local conscription."
 TMP_professional_army:0 "Professional Army"
 TMP_professional_army_desc:0 "The army led personally by Commander Tempest is one that is highly trained, drilled, and instilled within it absolute discipline. The storm creatures, already obedient creatures have risen up to her expectations of total loyalty, creating a force more effective than perhaps any other in the world. This discipline does not come without downsides however, and the army is limited in size and organization as not many can pass Tempest's harsh standards."
 TMP_equestrian_technological_monopoly:0 "Equestrian Technological Monopoly"
 TMP_equestrian_technological_monopoly_desc:0 "The storm creatures, for all their strength and power, are not exactly known for being the smartest creatures in the world. As such, practically all research and development is left to the few Equestrian exiles who followed Tempest to Storm Island, giving them a total monopoly on technological advancements. Their small number and limited resources mean they can only do so much, and even with their slow progress some storm creatures feel resentment at their perceived arrogance and demands."

 ### EVENTS ###
 tempest.1.t:0 "Gathering Stormclouds"
 tempest.1.d:0 ""Wow, what a day, huh? I mean, basically every day is like this now, and like, I was totally into how you absolutely destroyed that ambush earlier, but I'm starting to run out of sponge cake and you know how I get when I-"\n\n"Grubber."\n\n"Right, sorry."\n\nTempest Shadow closed her eyes and took a deep breath before returning her attention to the map in front of her. She knew the Storm Island well; it had been the closest thing to a home for a good part of her life. Here she had trained relentlessly in the mountains to grow stronger, all to one day regain what was taken from her. And now, after countless moons of subjugation campaigns under the Storm King's banner and subsequent soul-searching in Equestria, she was back.\n\n"Some of the guys are asking me when we're gonna go out and beat that poser," her hedgehog sidekick continued from behind her. "Personally, you know how much I like being here instead of out there, but that Storm Prince loser is getting stronger every day and losing a fight is not a good look for me. Uh, I mean us."\n\n"I am well aware of that, Grubber," Tempest replied. "Tell them to expect a war within the year. Glitter Drops is still working on finding more Equestrians to help."\n\nGrubber waddled up to sit on one of the stools strewn throughout the room. "Yeah, I don't think they'll be too happy about that either. I get that she's your friend and all that, but whenever she tries to give orders to the others it does not go well, let me tell you." The commander didn't offer a response. "Tempest? Hello?"\n\nTempest wasn't listening. Instead, she focused on the shard of stone next to the map. He had been a true tyrant, eccentric but cold and calculating enough to almost destroy Equestria once. She couldn't let it happen again. "Grubber, you're dismissed," she said, her voice hard. "I'll see you at dawn tomorrow."\n\nShe had to do this. She had to win, no matter what it took. Her friends, Princess Twilight, all of Equestria was counting on her even if they didn't know it yet.\n\nHer horn sparked with energy, burning a hole through the map where the old Storm Fortress was. It was time to go."
 tempest.1.a:0 "We can't afford to waste a single day."
 
 tempest.2.t:0 "The Right Hoof"
 tempest.2.d:0 "Tempest watched as the commander gave a gruff shout, signaling the start of the next training matches. Storm creatures below began fighting, some dueling with shield and blunted spears in hand; others with dark metal staffs firing blasts of magical electricity at storm creatures wielding massive two-handed spellshields. The victors would return to the barracks with all the amenities a struggling semi-state in the middle of nowhere could afford its army; the losers would be up until midnight maintaining the camp for the others. Society here was always centered around the strong commanding the weak; Tempest saw no issue in it, as long as it gave her results.\n\n"So, who do you think is gonna win?" Grubber asked, pointing to two storm creatures with spears locked in close quarters.\n\n"Does it matter?"\n\n"Well, no," the sidekick admitted, "but the guys have a lot of bets on it. There's gonna be a lot of storm bucks moving around tonight."\n\nThe mare rolled her eyes before settling her attention back on the fights below. "I'm glad you're here, Grubber," she said out of nowhere, surprising the small hedgehog. "How well do you know the soldiers down there?"\n\nGrubber looked down at the trainees. To most ponies, even to Tempest herself, the storm creatures looked identical past any weapons or armor identifying their rank or status. To Grubber, though, there was real recognition in those eyes. "Well some of them are pretty new," he admitted, "but I go way back with most of these guys. I think a few were even with us in Canterlot."\n\nAnd they talk to you about all their issues?"\n\n"Yeah, but only while they're on break. No offense, but they don't consider you the most approachable leader ever."\n\n"I know." Tempest bent down, lowering her neck to get closer to eye level with Grubber. "That's why I need your help. The storm creatures follow me because they respect me, but that may not last. I need you to keep an eye on them for me and let me know what I need to do to keep them loyal. Can you do that for me?"\n\nThe hedgehog gave as close to a salute as he could manage. "Got it, Tempest! Though uh, a few drinks would definitely help with that, if you have the chance. They're actually very talkative once they loosen up, I mean there was this one time back in Abyssinia...""
 tempest.2.a:0 "With their loyalty comes an army like no other."
