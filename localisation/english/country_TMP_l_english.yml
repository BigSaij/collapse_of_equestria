 ### CHARACTERS ###
 TMP_tempest_shadow:0 "Tempest Shadow"
 TMP_tempest_shadow_desc:0 "Tempest Shadow was born Fizzlepop Berrytwist, a unicorn in a small village within the western outskirts of Equestria. Talented with magic and holding dreams of attending the School for Gifted Unicorns in Canterlot alongside her friends Glitter Drops and Spring Rain, those dreams were shattered alongside her horn after an encounter with an ursa minor. Feeling betrayed by her friends after they abandoned her and left for Canterlot, Fizzlepop journeyed off out of Equestria southwards, seeking her place in a world that rejected her.\n\nAfter finding an artifact known as the Misfortune Malachite, Fizzlepop was confronted personally by the Storm King and given an offer; a position within his army as a Lieutenant and his new second-in-command, as well as a promise to fix her horn, in return for her total loyalty. She agreed, and shed off her old identity to become Tempest Shadow.\n\nShe served the Storm King faithfully for many moons, earning the respect of the storm creatures under her command and helping him conquer countless places with only one failure; the invasion of Hippogriffia, where Queen Novo was able to successfully escape with the Pearl of Transformation. It was Tempest who led the attack on Canterlot, and her who chased Princess Twilight and her friends across the lands south of Equestria culminating in her capture. But when the time came, she was betrayed by the Storm King, and switched sides to help Twilight destroy the mad tyrant.\n\nTempest temporarily took back her old name as she sought to refind her place in Equestria, rekindling friendships old and new. But once the Twilight Secession began and rumors spread that one on Storm Island was seeking to revive her old master, she knew that only she could stop this threat. Arriving with a few friends in tow and commanding her old storm creature subordinates by force, she is determined to prevent the return of the Storm King by any means necessary."

 ### IDEAS ###
 TMP_illegitimate_government:0 "Illegitimate Government"
 TMP_illegitimate_government_desc:0 "The lands Tempest Shadow controls are not so much a state or even a government as much as an army occupying land. The term 'Tempest Realm' is not even official, and is more of a name the Storm Creatures have taken to calling any territory occupied by Commander Tempest's forces. This total lack of government, while devoid of any red tape or bureaucratic complexity, does raise many issues for long-term stability and local conscription."
 TMP_professional_army:0 "Professional Army"
 TMP_professional_army_desc:0 "The army led personally by Commander Tempest is one that is highly trained, drilled, and instilled within it absolute discipline. The storm creatures, already obedient creatures have risen up to her expectations of total loyalty, creating a force more effective than perhaps any other in the world. This discipline does not come without downsides however, and the army is limited in size and organization as not many can pass Tempest's harsh standards."
 TMP_equestrian_technological_monopoly:0 "Equestrian Technological Monopoly"
 TMP_equestrian_technological_monopoly_desc:0 "The storm creatures, for all their strength and power, are not exactly known for being the smartest creatures in the world. As such, practically all research and development is left to the few Equestrian exiles who followed Tempest to Storm Island, giving them a total monopoly on technological advancements. Their small number and limited resources mean they can only do so much, and even with their slow progress some storm creatures feel resentment at their perceived arrogance and demands."
