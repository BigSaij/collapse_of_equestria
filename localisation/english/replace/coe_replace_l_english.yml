 LOW_SUPPLIES_TIPS:2 "The following actions may help you resolve the situation:\n - Spread out or reassign your units to reduce local consumption.\n\n - Build higher level infrastructure and make sure there are no railway bottlenecks from the capital.\n\n - If you have enough supply vehicles, you can motorize hubs in the region, giving them increased supply cap and range.\n\nIf supply in the area is being delivered by sea, you can also:\n - Upgrade the level of naval bases in source and destination provinces.\n\n - Make sure you have built enough convoys.\n\n - Make sure you escort convoys with 'Convoy escort' naval mission along the route.
